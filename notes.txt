1 set the height on the tab to be 90% of the page
2 add a history tab (where the rest get added in a sub tab)
3 add 2 potential categories and a ignore (funny/notfunny/not relevant)
4 on setting the category move the tab to history with saved category
5 have a "reveal" button that shows the rest
6 keep statistics on your personal usage of reddit

1 make default query include full list
#2 default dark theme


1 create default query to return on sending string
2 return 100 links (by default)
3 on click, pull off one of those links, 
  (eventually try to mark it as visited after a few seconds)
4 cycle through on a tablet/phone/laptop and see how it works  
  


1 poll frontpage
  create a "random" off of the frontpage with 5 comments
  b clicking on it takes you to the next one, it does inline images
    it displays 5 comments, and touching it takes you to the next one x

1 goals
  make it so that i can come in once a week and feel like I haven't missed anything on reddit
2 to do those goals
  poll reddit front page for a week (eventually polling other pages)
  create a query that shows the top front pages
   
  

1 write
  http://www.reddit.com/r/all/hot/.json
  create 5 random queries box
  do query save button
2 
  

1 specific category from subreddits
  a a list of subreddits to pull from, turn into a link to a specific query
  b eventually you can find it off of a category tree
2  

1 create tree
  a button to add new category
  b categories are initially personal categories, they get promoted to public
    if they are approved
  c initially general -> (funny/great/learning)  

1 category selection
  a a widget on links to set a category
    1 top level tree that you can click down into, 
    2 each selected category is a tree with that element selected
      a "go to parent" option, and associated children options
  b initial 5 categories are funny/notfunny/    

1 turn comments into partially minimized trees (the first 5 unminimized)
  pull back minor comments

1 determine how to paginate pullbacks so that already hit items can be eliminated
  a do a query for keys
  b save the keys, and the query in a temporary cache
  c run through keys, converting to history
  d keep a current location on the query and a % completed
  e
#1 cleanup 
#  a put selftext if available
#  b make sure comments actually show up

 b implement different getters
   1 date on creation
   2 category tree 
   3 limit to specific subreddits (default, a couple of large subs)
   4 limit to score (default to high%, high score)
  c implement refresh
   1 save clicked on elements according to date
   2 give a "total clicked links, that counts"
   3 only pull back new links
   4 do query like normal
     for each thing pulled back do batch gets to verify that they are new things, (by building a key of username+url), then pull back first x


1 start backend
  #a just do pure pullback
  #d implement clicking on link to dissapear, and add to the 5 tabbed clicked
  e implement ignore button
2 updown widget 
  a score data item
  b it can hold multiple things
  c it has a reporting system
1 reference explanation (up to 5 other links can be added as reference explanations)
  a both user input of categories and explanations have a up/down vote widget














1 do the individual page that shows stuff with the category selection
  a display link/5 comments/score/title

e clicking on links dissapears them (with additional selector), clicking ignore permanently ignores
  f there is a refresh button (all pulled from the selector are put to the bottom of the list
    and the bottom of the list is marked
  
1 reference explanation (up to 5 other links can be added as reference explanations)
  a both user input of categories and explanations have a up/down vote widget

2 updown widget 
  a score data item
  b it can hold multiple things
  c it has a reporting system









  b select some combination and you will get a listing of 5 links
  c defaults set appropriately
  g  






1 do the tree element
  a top level selectors date,category,subreddit,score,score%
    1 first is a date range, with a default of the past week (two date pickers)
    2 the second is a tree based category system (each top level category contains all
      beneath it)
    3 subreddits offer some choices, changes based on the categories selected
    4 score allows for 2 numbers
    5 score % pulls the score% closest to that
    6 each one is a tab, with some space added for the stuff  

#1 make the cache expire after 30 minutes
#2 run the test
4 put the bot into a scheduled servlet task
6 time to start using

5 write a bot that automatically does popular scores on reddits (form can force addition)
  a write a page that takes a list of subreddits
  b it then pulls the hot listing of those
  c it grabs the information and stores it
  d then write a tree element that displays it
  tree format, 5 comments, link, score
  ability to add categories
  date time limiter

1 put at least urls on frontend and a pick subreddit option
  a move code to frontend
  b make it so that it lists by title in a dropdown
  c on dropdown select it sets the url, saves the title, and then you pick categories

2 do rest call to pull down comments
 a list them out, along with title and score
 0
   
4 tree format



1 offer a couple random urls to pick from
 http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_hot  (test and look for upvotes here)
 http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/hot/.json
 

2 on submit the code does a reddit rest call to the thread  and pulls down the top 5 comments
http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_comments_{article}
http://www.reddit.com/comments/210xgq.json?depth=1&limit1

3 write page that has first 5 comments/ up/down votes / name / link to page / categories

4 write page where you can go into a tree format and pop out categories with first 5 lnks
  and a page that shows all the links
5 add a side option to restrict by dates/upvote %

the basic idea is reducedreddit.com
The theory is that reddit encourages addiction by not preserving old stuff very well
and thus making it easy to feel like you miss stuff.  This allows you to avoid that 
feeling.  

1 run and test form



1 write basic html form
2 add a hook for gwt
3 gwt adds up to 10 buttons through an ajax call to an objectify service.
4 form has a url link, a comma delimited list that is changed through the buttons
6 on submit the code does a reddit rest call to the thread  and pulls down the top 5 comments
  (if it hasn't updated today and it was pulled down recently then it tries to update once a day)
7 the basic idea is that reddit users can categorize recent topics of a subreddit

And finally you apply categories to yourself to allow another categorization







1 write a submission form
2 must be logged into google to submit
3 must give an appropriately formatted reddit url (it uses ajax to test)
4 10 buttons and a comma delimited list, buttons add that category name to the list
5 submit button

6 on submit the code does a reddit rest call to the thread  and pulls down the top 5 comments
  (if it hasn't updated today and it was pulled down recently then it tries to update once a day)
